# moab app

Welcome to my React project for Phase 2. This is a simple app based on a local burger joint that is much loved by myself and several others. The app itself displays the menu dishes on initial page load, all with images, descriptions and buttons to add the dishes to an Order array that tracks each item and its price, giving you a total bill amount for your order. All images are taken from the yelp page of the restaurant. I learned so much doing this project, and I still have idea to expans on it, but all tings must finish. So here it is.
